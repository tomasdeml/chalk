# chalk

Chalk is a command-line utility for export of commits from SourceGear Vault repository to Git. In comparison to https://github.com/AndreyNikiforov/vault2git Chalk uses Vault command line client (instead of API) and also supports export from a specific version (instead of the first repository version).
